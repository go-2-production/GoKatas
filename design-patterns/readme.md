# Design Patterns Katas

This is a collection of design pattern katas designed to help you learn and practice different design patterns in software development. Each kata focuses on a specific design pattern and provides exercises to implement that pattern in a practical manner.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work on the design pattern katas, you'll need the following:

- A programming language of your choice with a development environment set up.
- Familiarity with basic programming concepts and syntax in your chosen language.
- Knowledge of object-oriented programming principles.

### Setting Up the Repository

To get started with the design pattern katas, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- Each design pattern has its own directory containing the kata exercises and related resources.
- The name of each directory corresponds to the design pattern it focuses on.
- Inside each pattern directory, you will find the following files:

  - `README.md`: Provides an overview of the design pattern, its intent, and usage scenarios.
  - `exercise.md`: Contains the exercise instructions for implementing the design pattern.
  - `solution`: Directory for storing your completed solutions to the exercises.
  - Any additional resources or code samples necessary for the exercises.

## How to Use

1. Choose a design pattern you want to learn or practice.
2. Read the `README.md` file in the pattern's directory to understand the design pattern's concepts, benefits, and typical use cases.
3. Open the `exercise.md` file to view the kata exercise instructions.
4. Implement the design pattern based on the given exercise instructions.
5. Store your completed solution in the `solution` directory under the respective pattern's directory. You can create subdirectories within the `solution` directory if needed.
6. Optionally, compare your solution with the provided sample solution (if available) or seek feedback from others.

## Contributing
